#
#   This is the core configuration for service.  There are two examples here:
#
#       -  A configuration service which completely loads the configuration for the services
#          from the local file server of the config service. This should only be used for
#          demonstration purposes or for a small application with a limited number of services.
#
#       -  A configuration service that uses a git-based repository to read the files from.
